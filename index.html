    <h1>Student Performance Data Visualizations</h1>
    <p>This website presents 3 visualizations based on the Students Performance dataset from Kaggle.</p>

    <div class="viz-container">
        <h2>Visualization 1: Student Performance Analysis</h2>
        <img src="viz1_complexity.png" alt="Score distributions and correlations">
        <h3>Methodology:</h3>
        <p>This comprehensive analysis shows the distribution of scores across all three subjects through histograms, providing insight into the overall performance levels. The correlation heatmap reveals how performance in one subject relates to performance in others.</p>
        <h3>Results:</h3>
        <p>The majority of students score between 60-80 across subjects, with reading and writing scores showing similar distributions. The strong positive correlations (0.81-0.95) indicate that students who excel in one subject tend to perform well in others, suggesting consistent academic ability patterns.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="viz-container">
        <h2>Visualization 2: The Role of Parental Education in Academic Success</h2>
        <img src="viz2_trend.png" alt="Average scores by parental education level">
        <h3>Methodology:</h3>
        <p>Students were grouped by their parents' highest level of education, and average scores were calculated for each subject. The results are displayed in a grouped bar chart to facilitate comparison across education levels and subjects.</p>
        <h3>Results:</h3>
        <p>There is a clear positive relationship between parental education level and student performance. Students whose parents have advanced degrees (bachelor's or master's) achieve significantly higher scores across all subjects compared to those whose parents have only high school education, highlighting the importance of educational background in academic outcomes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="viz-container">
        <h2>Visualization 3: External Factors Affecting Mathematics Performance</h2>
        <img src="viz3_model.png" alt="Impact of test preparation and lunch programs">
        <h3>Methodology:</h3>
        <p>This analysis examines how two key external factors - participation in test preparation courses and lunch program status - influence mathematics performance. Average math scores were calculated for each category to identify practical interventions that can improve student outcomes.</p>
        <h3>Results:</h3>
        <p>Both factors show significant impact: students who completed test preparation courses scored 7.6 points higher on average (66.0 vs 73.6), while those with standard lunch programs scored 7.8 points higher than those with free/reduced lunch (58.9 vs 66.7). These findings suggest that both academic preparation and nutritional support are important for mathematics achievement.</p>
