# Student Performance Visualizations

This project contains 3 visualizations based on the Students Performance dataset from Kaggle.

## Visualizations

1. **Student Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive view of score distributions and correlations across mathematics, reading, and writing subjects.
2. **The Role of Parental Education in Academic Success**: Analysis showing how parental education level impacts student performance across all subjects.
3. **External Factors Affecting Mathematics Performance**: Examination of how test preparation courses and lunch programs influence mathematics achievement.
